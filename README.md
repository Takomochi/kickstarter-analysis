## Findings

### 1. Category
First of all, We looke at the category chart with filtering only by US. We can see that about 58% of Theater category are successful.
In subcategory chart, about 61% of Plays are successful. It is not high number, however, We can be confident about the category that Louise is choosing.

### 3. Boxplots
We filtered country as US, Subcategory as Plays and made Boxplots from their Goal and Pledged. 
We can see that there are many outliers. $10,000 of goal is already outlier of the amount of pledged.

## Recommendations
* They should launch the kickstarter campaign between May and June.
* They should consider to lower the amount of goal. At least Half of the initial amount($10,000).
